    ">*Research commissioned by the Turnbull government has ­estimated Australia’s emissions would be cut by up to 27 per cent if the country’s coal-based power generation ran on \"ultra-super-critical technology\", used in countries around the world.*\n",

    "Josh Frydenberg was unable to quantify the cost of this technology when questioned on [Radio National (24th Jan 2017)](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/no-plans-to-change-ret-frydenberg/8206540). This analysis attempts to firstly replicate the results prepared by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science and reported in the media. In addition to this, the costs of achieving this reduction using \"ultra-super-critical technology\" is also quantified. This is compared with other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "* Emissions from the electricity sector could be reduced by **27%** if the exiting coal power stations were replaced with ultra supercritical coal stations.\n",
    "* Approximately **20 GW** of new ultra supercritical coal power stations would be required.\n",
    "* The 20 GW required would cost approximately **\\$62 billion**.\n",
    "* The same emissions reduction could be achieved with **13-19 GW** of renewable energy, costing **\\$24-34** billion\n",
    "* \\$62 billion invested in renewable capacity could reduce emission in the electricity sector by **50% to 60%**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis quantifies the hypothetical emissions reduction achievable by replacing the current fleet of subcritical and supercritical power stations with new ultra super-critical technology. Generation data from individual power stations in 2016, combined with the latest emissions factor assumptions [from AEMO](https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Planning-and-forecasting/National-Transmission-Network-Development-Plan/NTNDP-database) was used to calculate energy output and the resulting emissions. The energy was assumed to be replaced with ultra super-critical technology, with an emissions intensity of 700g/kWh (0.7 tonne/MWh). From this, the hypothetical reduction of emissions can be quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy output from the existing coal fired powerstation can also be used to estimate the quantify for the capacity of new ultra super-critical technology. To determine this, a capacity factor of 0.85 was used. This capacity can be combined with capital cost estimates from the [Australian Power Generation Technology Report](http://www.co2crc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LCOE_Report_final_web.pdf) to estimate total costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs and emissions outcome were compared with renewable energy using a similar approach. In the first case, the emissions reductions were assumed to be achieved, albeit using renewable energy. In the second case, the same amount of money was assumed to be spent on renewable energy capacity, and the emissions reductions calculated. This was based on the high end of the cost recently [reported in the AFR](http://www.afr.com/business/energy/solar-energy/solar-closing-cost-gap-with-wind-conventional-power-20170113-gtqw91) at between \\$1,570-\\$1,780 / kW.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and code\n",
    "\n",
    "The data (emissions intensity, station energy output) and code to arrive at these results are available on [github](https://github.com/dylanjmcconnell/hele_coal) (and below), should anyone wish to examine or replicate the analyis. The raw genaration data is in units of GWh (as generated) and the raw emissions data is in units of tonnes CO₂-eq (as generated)."
